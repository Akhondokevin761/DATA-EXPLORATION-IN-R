-dplyr

-ggplot2

-tidyverse

-writexl

```


## Project Structure

This section outlines how files and directories are organized. It further brief description of each component.

### Directory Structure

- 'Data/' : Contains data used in this project
- 'Code/' : Contains the RMarkdown  of data exploration


### 'Data/'

This contains the original sample data named "smartphone_category(1).csv" that was used in the exploration and the final exported data from R-Studio named "SMARTPHONEDATA.xlsx" which has an additional variable named Performance.

### 'Code/'

Contains the RMarkdown named "pro1.Rmd" that outlines all the steps used in data exploration from step 1 of loading the libraries to final step of exporting the data to xlsx file.


## Data

This is mainly a folder that contains the sample data(smartphone_category(1).csv) and the final exported data(SMARTPHONEDATA.xlsx) used in this project.
